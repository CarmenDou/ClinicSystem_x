# ClinicSystem

The system consists of two main components:

- a **RESTful backend** that is connected to a **database**. This backend sends, receives, and stores the data for all participants.
- a **Web Portal** for clinicians. This portal displays reports and analysis of the Raynauds records collected from the app.
